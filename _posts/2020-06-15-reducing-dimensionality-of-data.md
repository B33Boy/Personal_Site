summary: Hinton, and Salakhutdinov's 2006 paper "Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks", proposes a method to find the lower dimensional representation of data by initializing the weights of an autoencoder network such that it is close to a solution. This method is stated to even outclass Principle Component Analysis (PCA).

### Paper: [Hinton, and Salakhutdinov](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/science.pdf)

Hinton, and Salakhutdinov's 2006 paper "Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks", proposes a method to find the lower dimensional representation of data by initializing the weights of an autoencoder network such that it is close to a solution. This method is stated to even outclass Principle Component Analysis (PCA).
